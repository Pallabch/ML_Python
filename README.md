# ML_Python
Final Project under Globsyn finishing school for the course of "Machine Learning using Python".

The source code along with all graphs and comments is in the .ipynb file, Github might fail to render the file it can be viewed here 
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Pallabch/ML_Python/blob/master/Final_Interview_prediction.ipynb

or if the above link fails just paste this URL "https://github.com/Pallabch/ML_Python/blob/master/Final_Interview_prediction.ipynb"
in here https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/.

Documentation and a presentation has been included but it simplifies a lot of the work that we actually did in cleansing the data and then using different models and finding their scores, all the work is heavily commented and markded in the ipynb file.
